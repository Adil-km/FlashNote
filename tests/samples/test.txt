Plants prepare their own food through a process called photosynthesis. In this process, they use sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide to make glucose, which gives them energy to grow. At the same time, they release oxygen into the air, which is very important for humans and animals to breathe. Photosynthesis is essential for life on Earth.
