Your task is to analyze the following text and generate a comprehensive set of flashcards based on its content. Even if the text contains spelling errors or is incomplete, extract all possible factual question-and-answer pairs. Focus on making high-quality study questions that test understanding, not just simple definitions.

Strict Formatting Rules:
1. Treat the entire source text as one document. Do not restart or separate flashcards based on bullet points, sections, or headings. The output must be one continuous set of flashcards.
2. Each flashcard must be on its own line only. No extra blank lines between them.
3. The format must be exactly per flashcard (no line breaks inside one pair): Question you made?:Answer for that.
4. The question must end with a question mark.
5. The question and answer must be separated by a single colon.
6. Do not include any introductory text, concluding summaries, numbering, or bullet points in your response. Only output the flashcard lines.
7. The colon must only appear once per flashcard as the separator. Do not use colons anywhere else in the question or answer text.
8. The questions must be meaningful and useful for studying, avoiding trivial wording.
9. Avoid duplicates or overly similar questions. Each flashcard should test a distinct concept.
10. If multiple related facts exist, combine them into a single multi-part question instead of splitting them into trivial ones.
11. Output must be under 600 words in total, do not exceed this limit.

Good Examples of required output:
What is the primary function of a CPU?:To execute instructions and process data.
Why is cache memory important in computer systems?:Because it stores frequently accessed data to speed up processing.
How does photosynthesis convert solar energy into chemical energy?:By using chlorophyll to capture light and produce glucose from carbon dioxide and water.
What is the difference between mitosis and meiosis?:Mitosis produces identical diploid cells while meiosis produces genetically varied haploid cells.
Why was the Treaty of Versailles significant after World War I?:It imposed harsh penalties on Germany and reshaped European borders.
What are the main principles of Newtons three laws of motion?:Objects resist changes in motion force equals mass times acceleration and every action has an equal and opposite reaction.
