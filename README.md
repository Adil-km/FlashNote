## About FlashNote :anchor:

Making flashcards is a huge hassle. The process is a major time sink, and it's tough to create cards that are actually effective. We built FlashNote to solve this problem by taking the tedious work off your hands.

FlashNote uses AI to automatically transform your study notes into structured, high-quality flashcards. Instead of spending hours reading through material and manually creating cards, you can get a ready-to-use Anki CSV file in seconds, allowing you to focus on what matters most: learning.
